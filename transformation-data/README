Script Idea: Analyze an Apache Access Log

Objective:
Write a script that:

    Extracts all requests that returned a 404 error (grep).

    Formats the output to show only the IP address and URL (awk).

    Replaces repeated slashes // with a single / in URLs (sed).

    Counts and lists the top 5 IPs that caused 404 errors.
